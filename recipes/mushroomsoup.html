    <h2>Easy Mushroom soup</h2>

    <p>This simple, delicious recipe is made without cream or milk. <br>
        A mix of butter and flour thicken chicken stock to create a velvety soup without being too heavy. <br>
        The combination of crimini and white button mushrooms add earthy notes that work well with the rich broth.</p>

    <h3>Required ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 ounces white button mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>Sliced sautéed mushrooms for garnish, optional</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley for garnish, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large pot such as a Dutch oven over <br>
            medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallot, cook for 1 minute, until they <br>
            begin to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes, until <br>
            tender and browned. Transfer all the contents of the pot to a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the pot. Once melted, sprinkle <br>
            in the flour and whisk it quickly into a paste. Reduce the heat to medium. <br>
            Add the stock a little at a time, whisking out the clumps between each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase the heat back to medium-high and allow the soup to simmer well <br>
            for 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the pot and continue to cook <br>
            for 2 more minutes. The stock will thicken slightly to be somewhat creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then ladle into bowls. Garnish with mushrooms <br>
            and parsley, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
